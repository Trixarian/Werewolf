LYNCH-LEFT
The guilty party has left, no lynching.

VILLAGER-LYNCH
The air thick with adrenaline, the villagers grab PLAYER who struggles furiously, pleading innocence, but the screams fall on deaf ears. PLAYER is dragged to the stake at the edge of the village, and burned alive. But the villagers shouts and cheers fade as they realise the moon is already up - PLAYER was not a werewolf after all...
Realising the angry mob is turning, PLAYER tries to run, but is quickly seized upon. PLAYER is strung up to the hanging tree, and a hunter readies his rifle with a silver slug, as the block is kicked from beneath them. But there is a dull snap, and PLAYER hangs, silent, motionless. The silent villagers quickly realise their grave mistake...

WOLF-LYNCH
After coming to a decision, PLAYER is quickly dragged from the crowd, and dragged to the hanging tree. PLAYER is strung up, and the block kicked from beneath their feet. There is a yelp of pain, but PLAYER's neck doesn't snap, and fur begins to sprout from their body. A gunshot rings out, as a villager puts a silver bullet in the beast's head...

SEER-LYNCH
PLAYER runs before the mob is organised, dashing away from the village. Tackled to the ground near to the lake, PLAYER is tied to a log, screaming, and thrown into the water. With no means of escape, PLAYER drowns, but as the villagers watch, tarot cards float to the surface and their mistake is all too apparent...

IS-LYNCHED
PLAYER, the ROLE, is lynched!

NO-LYNCH
As the sun gets low in the sky, the villagers are unable to reach a decision on who to lynch, and without the momentum of a united mob, the crowd slowly dissipates to take shelter in their homes...

VILLAGER-KILL
The villagers gather the next morning in the village center, but PLAYER does not appear. The villagers converge on PLAYER's home and find them decapitated in their bed. After carrying the body to the church, the villagers, now hysterical, return to the village center to decide how to retaliate...
As some villagers begin to gather in the village center, a scream is heard from the direction of PLAYER's house. The elderly villager who had screamed points to the fence, on top of which, the remains of PLAYER are impaled, with their intestines spilling onto the cobbles. Apparently PLAYER was trying to flee their attacker...
When the villagers gather at the village center, one comes running from the hanging tree, screaming at others to follow. When they arrive at the hanging ree, a gentle creaking echoes through the air as the body of PLAYER swings gently in the breeze, it's arms ripped off at the shoulders. It appears the attacker was not without a sense of irony...
As the village priest gathers the prayer books for the mornings sermon, he notices a trickle of blood snaking down the aisle.. He looks upward to see PLAYER impaled on the crucifix - the corpse has been gutted. He shouts for help, and the other villagers pile into the church, and start arguing furiously...

SEER-KILL
The first villager to arrive at the center shrieks in horror - lying on the cobbles is a blood stained Ouija Board, and atop it sits PLAYER's head. It appears PLAYER had been seeking the guidance of the spirits to root out the WOLF, but apparently the magic eight ball didn't see THIS one coming...

IS-KILLED
PLAYER, the ROLE, has been killed!

NO-KILL
The villagers gather the next morning in the village center, to sighs of relief - it appears there was no attack the previous night.

NOT-VOTED
Having defied the powers of Good and Justice for long enough, PLAYER suddenly clutches their chest, before falling to the floor as blood pours from their ears. May that be a lesson to all who attempt to defend the WOLF.

NOT-VOTED-NOTICE
You have been removed from the game for not voting for two Lynch Votes in a row.

WOLF-WIN
Having successfully deceived the rest of the village's population, PLAYER the Werewolf, breaks into the final villager's home and rips out their jugular. PLAYER bays at the moon, before setting off to the next village...

WOLVES-WIN
That night, their plan of deception finally bearing it's fruit, the Werewolves finish off the rest of the human population, and feast, before bounding off together, towards the next village...

VILLAGERS-WIN
With the beasts slain, the villagers cheer! Their peaceful village is once again free from the scourge of the WOLF!

Someone type !start. I implore you!
You know, there's a great game in this channel...
WAFFLES
PLAYER finds a shortcut! This wondrous godsend brings them RANDDUR closer to level RANDNUM. Oh, wait, this isn't #idle...
*yawn*
Anyone can start a game if they like.
How about a nice quick game of me?
Betcha scared of losing. That's why you won't play.
Wow. Didn't think people were this boring...
A lynch a day keeps the murderous tendancies away. *nods*
It's so easy... Happy go-oh lucky...
Rowr. That's the sound of a werewolf. I thought I'd just remind you.

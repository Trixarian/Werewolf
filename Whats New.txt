From 0.97b release:
Changes:
-Bot now reads texts from files.
-Added secret game mode. (Different texts)
-Values for day night and vote times, and the vote tie condition, are now added to the .ini file.
-Added idle barks by the bot, when there is no game in progress. These can be disabled by editing the werewolf.ini option 'idlebarks' to off, or by typing !shush/!speak while the bot is online
-At the end of a game, the voices are removed in groups of 4, a la day/night changes.

Bugfixes:
-Stopped wolves being able to kill already dead villagers.
-The bot now sets mode -N on quit (If permitted by the server)
-If a person leaves after being voted for a lynch, but before the votes are tallied, the bot no longer hangs.

Known Issues:
-If someone changes their nick after getting a majority vote, but before the tally, they survive, and the bot hangs. A way to resolve this is for the wolf to leave and reenter the channel

Plans for later versions:
-More file customization possibilities
-Game stats; Who has been wolf, number of villager/wolf victories, seer survival rate, etc.

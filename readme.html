<h2><u>What is the Werewolf Game?</u></h2>
</strong> 
<p>The Werewolf Game is a social game that has gone through many incarnations. 
  It started as a party game, where a group of people sat in a circle facing eachother. 
  Another form of the game has evolved with the emergance of the Internet, which 
  is played on forums and BBSs. Having recently discovered it, Darkshine and I 
  decided to make an IRC version, with a bot as moderator. And here it is!</p>
<p>The basic rules are as follows: a number of people from the group are randomly 
  selected to be 'Werewolves'. The rest are 'Villagers'. The game is split into 
  2 parts, night and day. During the night, the werewolf/wolves can secretly select 
  a single villager to 'eat'. During the day, the victim from the previous night 
  is revealed and removed from the game. During the day, everyone, including the 
  werewolves, discuss who they believe the werewolves to be, using some guesswork, 
  as well as logic and reasoning. At the end of the day, everyone must vote who 
  they suspect to be a werewolf to be lynched. This continues until one of the 
  two following winning conditions is satisfied.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Werewolves are equal to the Villagers. (Werewolves win)</li>
  <li>The Villagers lynch all the Werewolves. (Villagers win)</li>
</ul>
<p>All votes for either choosing a victim (Werewolves) or voting someone to lynch 
  (everyone) are given to a moderator, who keeps everyone's identity secret.</p>
<p>Various roles have been integrated into the game, including, but not limited 
  to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Seer - who can select a single person each night to discover their identity 
    (Werewolf or Villager)</li>
  <li> Guardian Angel - who can select one person to protect during the night. 
    If the person is attacked by the werewolves, he survives. If the Guardian 
    Angel is atacked, he has a 1 in 10 chance to protect himself.</li>
  <li>Vigilante - A Villager who can choose any person to attack and kill during 
    the day only once in a game.</li>
  <li>Psychic - Similar to the Seer, is given information on the Villagers each 
    night. But in this case, he is only informed how many Werewolves remain. Useful 
    if the lynched person is a wolf, but the players roles are not revealed with 
    their death.</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned, there are many variations in gameplay, with different roles, 
  as well as rules such as revealing the dead person's role in the game or not, 
  etc.</p>

<h2><strong><u>What is the Werewolf Game Bot?</u></strong></h2>
<p>The Werewolf Game Bot is an IRC bot coded in Java, based on the PircBot framework 
  found at <a href="http://www.jibble.org">http://www.jibble.org/</a>.<br>
  It acts as the moderator in instances of the Werewolf Game. It assigns people's 
  roles in the game, narrates the happenings in the village, times the duration 
  of the day and night, collects people votes and calculates the results.<br>
  The rules it follows are the following (based on the rules found <a href="http://www.eblong.com/zarf/werewolf.html">here</a>):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Minumum players: 5</li>
  <li>Maximum players: 12</li>
  <li>Maximum wolves: 2 (2nd introduced at 8 players)</li>
  <li>Special roles: Seer</li>
  <li>Identities revealed on death.</li>
  <li>Lynched Villagers are permitted a single line of text as their 'dying breath'.</li>
  <li>If a player doesn't vote for two consecutive rounds, they are automatically 
    executed. </li>
</ul>

<h2><strong><u>What Commands are available?</u></strong></h2>
<p>There are several commands available to users/players, to control the game.</p>
<ul>
  <li>!start - Begins a game, and enters the person who gave the command into 
    the game.</li>
  <li>!daytime (x) - (Channel OPs only) Determines the length in seconds of the 
    day, when people can discuss suspicions etc. If no argument is provided, if 
    gives the current duration.</li>
  <li>!nighttime (x) - (Channel OPs only) Determines the length in seconds of 
    the night, when the werewolf/wolves select their victim and the Seer selects 
    who to view. If no argument is provided, if gives the current duration.</li>
  <li>!votetime (x) - (Channel OPs only) Determines the length in seconds of the 
    Lynch Vote, when people cast their votes on who should be lynched. If no argument 
    is provided, if gives the current duration.</li>
  <li>!tie (on/off) - (Channel OPs only) Activates or deactivates the Lynch Tie. 
    If the tie is activated and there are an equal number of votes for 2 or more 
    players during the Lynch Vote, one of them will be randomly selected. Otherwise, 
    no-one will be lynched. If no argument is provided, it gives the current status 
    of the flag.</li>
